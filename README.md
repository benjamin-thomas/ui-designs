# Implementation of various UI components in HTML/CSS.

This is just me trying to reproduce various designs found on the web.

I try to keep the HTML markup as lean as possible (no extra
 divs for styling, etc.)

Keeping for reference and inspiration.

## Development

Use this tool

```bash
npm install -g live-server
live-server --no-browser
```

Note to self: only use relative links, ok for dev env and live github
 pages.

## Go to live environment

### Step 1

Navigate to [my github pages](https://benjamin-thomas.github.io/ui-designs/)

### Step 2

Visualise any of these pages
